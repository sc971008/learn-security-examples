- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vunerability in the insecured version is that its request handler did not have mechanish
to stop large number of request. The secured version handled that valunerbility by add a try
catch block to handle error if the request is not reponsive.'
Addtionally we can add layer of protection to DDos attcak by set a counter to make the server
only take certain number of request from a user session in a time peorids.
