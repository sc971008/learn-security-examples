The vunlarbility of insecure.js's design is that 
using the request's input string directly without any process. 
Hacker might inject script inside the request which is very dangerous. 
For example. if we input a script with hyper link as name. 
The website will render the name directly and leading to harm.
Secure.js limited that threat by sanitizing the request's documents.
